I am currently working on learning ~~the react-native framework~~ Flutter!

Also I am working on creating a [clone](https://github.com/riley0122/numworks_doom) of the game [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) for the [Numwokrs](https://numworks.com) calculator :)

#### Tools and technologies
I am familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, and C++. I also know most of the Python language, Java, and go. I am also trying to learn dart to go along with Flutter.

My favourite way of using JavaScript or Typescript is with Node.js, I have often made web apps, APIs, and Discord bots with Discord.js.

Javascript is my most used language, with C++ falling into second place.

The website I am currently writing ([riley0122.dev](https://riley0122.dev)) is being written with PHP and TypeScript togethere with TailwindCSS.
