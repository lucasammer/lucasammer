I am currently working on learning the react-native framework!

#### Tools and technologies
I am familiar with Javascript, C#, and C++. I also know most of the Python language and go.

My favourite way of using JavaScript is with Node.js, I have often made web apps, APIs, and Discord bots with Discord.js.

Javascript is my most used language, with C++ falling into second place.
