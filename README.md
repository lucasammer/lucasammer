#### Tools and technologies
I am familliar with Javascript, C#, and C++. I also know most of python and go.

My favorite way of using JavaScript is with Node.js, I have often made webApps, api's, and Discord bots with Discord.js.

Javascript is my most used language, with C++ falling into second place.
